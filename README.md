# ⚙️ Python Automation Tool (Tkinter)

A desktop application built with **Python and Tkinter** designed to automate common file-management and workflow tasks.
This project focuses on combining GUI development with automation logic, while improving my skills in Python, architecture and practical software design.

## 🚀 Planned Features

- 📁 Batch file renaming  
- 🔄 Folder sorting & organization  
- 🔧 File format conversions  
- 📦 Automated copy/move operations  
- 🧹 Cleanup utilities (duplicate removal, empty-folder detection)  
- 🎛️ Simple and intuitive Tkinter interface  

(Features will be added progressively as the project evolves.)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn and apply Tkinter for desktop UI development  
- Develop clean and modular Python code  
- Practice automation logic used in real environments  
- Build a portfolio-ready project with meaningful functionality  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**  
- **Tkinter** (built into Python — no installation needed)  
- Standard libraries: `os`, `shutil`, `pathlib`, `fileinput`, etc.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- Designing user interfaces with Tkinter  
- Event-driven programming  
- Building reusable modules for automation  
- Implementing automation algorithms in a real GUI environment  
- Structuring a complete project for GitHub
